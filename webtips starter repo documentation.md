👉 Step 6: If your application also has end to end tests that are written and run using playwright, then follow these steps: \
    - 👉 Step 1: Run this command: __npm init playwright@latest__ to initialize the project as a playwright project\
    - 👉 Step 2: It will ask whether you want to continue with typescript or javascript. By default, it will take typescript. If your project uses JavaScript, give JavaScript option.  \
    - 👉 Step 3: The moment playwright is installed, it will also give some sample tests. It will ask where these tests should be. By default, all the tests will be in tests folder. Specify that the tests must be stored in a folder called Acceptance_Tests. \
    - 👉 Step 4: When installing playwright, it will ask whether to create a GitHub Actions workflow. Give no for this option because the starter repo already has a workflow to run the playwright tests. \
